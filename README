= About =

  A tabbed Twitter interface.
  
  A chat room can be:
  
  - a Twitter search stream (for example, a hashtag)
  - a user's timeline
  - a user's private list stream
  - current user private messages
  - current user private messages with another user (emulating PVT messaging/chatrooms)

  For the purpose of Node Knockout, the goal is to allow creating rooms to follow public hashtags (work in progress)
  
  
 = Implementation =
 
 - Data I/O between chatrooms and server is abstracted using the dojo publish/subscriber model. This allows easy implementation
 of adicional networks, as facebook, real IRC ...  
 - Core features are implemented in a "kernel" and everything else is implemented using plugins 

= Requirements =

  * NPM modules
  
  - connect
  - connect-auth
  - oauth
